# EHC Assessment App — Environment Variables
#
# This app does NOT require any environment variables.
# All configuration is managed through the in-app Settings screen:
#   - Google Sheets connection (OAuth Client ID, Spreadsheet ID)
#   - Authentication settings (require sign-in, allowed emails)
#   - Idle timeout settings
#
# Configuration is stored in IndexedDB on the client device.
#
# For deployment, see vercel.json or the hosting provider's security
# header configuration to ensure proper HTTP security headers are set.
